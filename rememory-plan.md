# ReMemory — Protocol & Implementation Plan

**Codename:** Orange Plan
**Version:** 0.2 — Refined after research
**Last updated:** 2026-02-02

---

## One-line summary

A CLI tool that encrypts a small manifest of "keys to the kingdom" with `age`, splits the passphrase via Shamir's Secret Sharing, and packages self-contained recovery bundles for distribution to trusted friends.

---

## What this is (and isn't)

**IS:** A system to give trusted people the ability to reconstruct a single passphrase that decrypts a small file (~10MB) containing credentials, recovery codes, and a map of where everything lives. Think of it as a master index — not a backup of the data itself.

**IS NOT:** A vault, a backup system, a file sync tool, or a dead man's switch (though it can be composed with one later).

The encrypted cloud backups already exist. ReMemory is the last mile: getting the right people access to those backups when you can't do it yourself.

```

notes:

the idea is for the manifest to be basically a folder that gets turned into a tar file, inside the folder is where I will put my 1password recovery kit, and other important files. the tool needs to guide the user through creating this manifest, encrypting it, splitting the key, and generating the bundles.

rememory init needs to start like a new project, so it creates a new folder with the right files inside:
- project.yml
- manifest/ folder where files go
- manifest/readme.md (readme for decrypted bundle, by default its generated with ideas of what to populate this with, meant for me to re-write before encrypting)

the other rememory commands i run inside that project

in the project.yml is where i define my friends names and their contact details, the software asks me for them as it generates the project. i can base a project on an old one, to ocpy the friends, etc

i want to combine more things, i want seal to also do split (no separate split), also, i want split to do the test automatically. split by default doesn't show
the password (i don't need to, the command does all things and gives me validated bundles) - the signature of each friend's bundle is written to project yaml so it can be verified in the future

---

## What goes in the manifest

The tool should guide the user through creating this with interactive prompts and a template. The manifest is a structured document (markdown or JSON) containing:

### Tier 1 — The skeleton key (unlocks everything else)
- **Password manager:** 1Password/Bitwarden master password, secret key, account URL
- **Primary email:** password, 2FA backup codes, recovery email/phone
- **Phone PIN / device passcodes**

### Tier 2 — Financial & critical accounts
- **Bank accounts:** institution, login, 2FA method, backup codes
- **Crypto wallets:** seed phrases, hardware wallet PINs, derivation paths, which chains
- **Cloud storage:** provider, login (or note "accessible via email recovery")
- **Borg backup:** repo location, encryption passphrase
- **Yubikeys**: physical location, PINs, PUKs

### Tier 3 — The map (where stuff lives)
- **What is backed up where:** "Photos → iCloud + Backblaze", "Documents → Google Drive + encrypted Syncthing to NAS"
- **Hardware locations:** "NAS is in the closet, password is in 1Password under 'Synology'"
- **Recovery sequences:** "To get into my laptop, first recover email, then use Apple ID recovery, then..."
- **Legal contacts:** lawyer name/phone, will location

### Tier 4 — Personal wishes (optional)
- What to do with social media accounts
- Who should have access to what
- Messages to specific people

### What to EXCLUDE
- Sensitive employment / NDA-covered information
- Client/patient confidential data
- Anything that should go through a lawyer instead
- The manifest itself should never be stored in a will (wills become public record)

---

## Technical decisions

### Language: Go

**Rationale:**
- Static binaries by default, no runtime dependencies — critical for bundles that must work in 10+ years
- Hashicorp Vault's SSS library is battle-tested Go code, directly importable
- `age` reference implementation is Go, can embed as library
- Cross-compilation is trivial: `GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build`
- Simpler than Rust for a project of this scope; the crypto primitives are in libraries, not hand-rolled

**Rust alternative considered:** dsprenkels/sss has better side-channel resistance, and rage (Rust age) is solid. But Go's compilation story and library ecosystem are more practical here. The threat model doesn't include side-channel attacks on the tool itself (the attacker would need physical access to the machine during split/recover operations).

### Encryption: age (not GPG)

**Rationale:**
- Symmetric mode (`age -p`) with a passphrase is all we need
- No key management, no algorithm negotiation, no config files
- Modern crypto: XChaCha20-Poly1305, scrypt for key derivation
- The passphrase becomes the Shamir-split secret — simple, clean
- Implementations exist in Go (reference), Rust (rage), JS — recovery doesn't depend on a single codebase
- Spec is frozen and documented at age-encryption.org/v1

**GPG rejected because:** algorithm negotiation attack surface, backward-compatibility baggage, complexity that kills usability in emergency recovery scenarios. Friends don't need to understand public key infrastructure.

### Secret sharing: Hashicorp Vault's shamir package

**Rationale:**
- Extracted from Vault (32k+ stars), regularly audited
- Clean API: `Split(secret, parts, threshold)` → `[][]byte`
- GF(2^8) arithmetic, works on arbitrary byte strings
- Well-maintained, unlikely to disappear

**Considerations:**
- No integrity verification on shares (basic SSS limitation). Mitigated by: each share file includes a SHA-256 checksum of itself, and the tool verifies checksums before attempting reconstruction.
- No verifiable secret sharing (Feldman/Pedersen). Acceptable for this threat model — we trust share holders to be honest, the risk is share corruption/loss, not adversarial share submission.

### Default threshold: 3-of-5

**Rationale:**
- 5 trusted friends is realistic to maintain over decades
- Threshold of 3 means: any 2 people colluding can't recover; losing 2 shares doesn't lock you out
- Can be configured: 2-of-3 for simpler setups, 4-of-7 for higher security

### Bundle format

Each friend receives a ZIP file (or a USB drive containing):

| File | Purpose | Format |
|------|---------|--------|
| `README.pdf` | Human instructions: what this is, when to use it, how to contact others, step-by-step recovery | PDF/A-1a (archival, self-contained) |
| `README.txt` | Same content as plaintext fallback | UTF-8 text |
| `MANIFEST.age` | The encrypted payload | age binary format |
| `SHARE-3of5-alice.txt` | This person's Shamir share + metadata | Base64-encoded, with checksum |
| `CONTACTS.txt` | Names + contact info for all other share holders | Plaintext |
| `METADATA.json` | Tool version, creation date, threshold, total shares, share index | JSON |
| `rememory-*` | Static binaries for linux/mac/windows (amd64 + arm64) | ~10MB each |
| `recover.html` | Offline single-page app: paste shares → get passphrase → paste into age | HTML + WASM |
| `checksums.txt` | SHA-256 of every file in the bundle | Plaintext |

**Total bundle size estimate:** 50-70MB (dominated by the 5 static binaries). The actual secret payload is <10MB.

## CLI design

```
rememory init                    # Create a new manifest from guided prompts/template
rememory edit                    # Open manifest for editing
rememory seal                    # Encrypt manifest → MANIFEST.age (prompts for passphrase or generates one)
rememory split                   # Split passphrase into shares according to manifest config
rememory bundle [--output ./bundles/]       # Generate per-person ZIP bundles
rememory verify                  # Test that K shares reconstruct correctly
rememory recover <share1> <share2> ...      # Reconstruct passphrase, decrypt manifest
rememory rotate                  # Generate new passphrase, re-encrypt, re-split (for periodic updates)
rememory status                  # Show current config: who holds shares, when last rotated, when to rotate next
rememory verify-bundle <bundle.zip>   # Verify integrity of a given bundle
```

# Composed workflow
rememory init && rememory seal && rememory split && rememory bundle
# Or: rememory seal-and-bundle (all-in-one)

## Open questions resolved

### Should others really have access to my data in case of death?
**Yes, but scoped.** The manifest controls what they can access. You're not giving them your data — you're giving them a map + the key to the front door. What's behind each subsequent door is up to each service's own access controls. Pair this with proper legal estate planning (will, digital executor designation).

### How to expire old keys?
**Rotation, not expiration.** `rememory rotate` generates a new passphrase, re-encrypts the manifest, creates new shares. Old shares become useless because they reconstruct the old passphrase, which no longer decrypts anything. Old bundles should be physically destroyed/deleted. The CONTACTS.txt instructs holders to destroy old bundles upon receiving new ones.

### How will these people contact each other?
**CONTACTS.txt in every bundle.** Contains name, phone, email, and optionally a secondary contact method for each share holder. Updated on each rotation. The README.pdf instructs holders to contact each other if they believe recovery is needed.

### Should the system be online or offline?
**Offline-first, online-optional.** The core system is completely offline — no servers, no accounts, no services to shut down. A future extension could add a dead man's switch (email-based check-in) that notifies share holders when to act, but the recovery mechanism itself must work without internet.

## Threat model & failure modes

### What we defend against
| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| You lose memory / get incapacitated | Friends reconstruct passphrase, follow the map |
| You die | Same as above; legal executor + friends cooperate |
| A single friend is compromised/adversarial | Threshold prevents single-share recovery |
| Two friends collude (in 3-of-5) | Need 3 — still safe with 2 colluding |
| Friend loses their share | 3-of-5 tolerates losing 2 shares |
| Software doesn't exist in 10 years | Static binaries + WASM fallback + recovery is just "get passphrase, decrypt with age" — age will exist, or the spec is simple enough to reimplement |
| USB drive degrades | Recommend M-Disc + refreshed USB every 2-3 years + encrypted cloud copy |

### What we DON'T defend against
| Threat | Why | Mitigation |
|--------|-----|------------|
| Threshold of friends all collude | By design — if 3 of your 5 most trusted people conspire, you have bigger problems | Choose friends from different social circles |
| Sophisticated side-channel attacks during split/recover | Tool runs on user's own machine; attacker needs physical/remote access | Use a trusted machine, air-gapped if paranoid |
| Quantum computing breaks age's crypto | Decades away for symmetric crypto (XChaCha20 is 256-bit) | age's symmetric mode is quantum-resistant |
| Long-term relationship drift | People move, lose touch, fall out over decades | Rotate every 2-3 years; replace holders as needed |
| Friends don't understand the instructions | | Invest heavily in README quality; test with real people |

### Known SSS implementation risks (from research)
- **No integrity verification on basic SSS:** a corrupted share produces a wrong passphrase silently. Mitigated by: include a checksum of the original passphrase (or a verification hash) in METADATA.json so recovery can confirm success.
- **Secret exists in memory during split and recovery:** unavoidable single point of failure at generation time. Accept this risk.
- **No share revocation without full rotation:** can't invalidate one person's share without re-splitting. This is fine — rotation is the answer.

## Existing tools to use vs. build

### USE off the shelf
| Component | Tool | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Encryption | `age` (filipposottile/age) | Use as Go library, not CLI dependency |
| SSS | `hashicorp/vault/shamir` | Import the package directly |
| PDF generation | Go library (e.g., `jung-kurt/gofpdf` or `go-pdf/fpdf`) | For README.pdf in bundles |
| WASM | Go's built-in WASM target | For recover.html fallback |

### BUILD custom
| Component | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Manifest template & guided init | No existing tool does this |
| Bundle packaging | Unique to our format |
| Share file format with checksums | Needs to be human-readable + verifiable |
| Recovery verification | Need to test round-trip without exposing the secret |
| CLI orchestration | Glue between components |

### DEFER (future extensions)
| Feature | Tool/Pattern | When |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Dead man's switch | storopoli/dead-man-switch (Rust) or custom Go service | v2 — after core works |
| Timelock encryption | drand/tlock | v2 — auto-release after time period |
| Proactive share refresh | PSS protocol | v3 — only if rotation logistics become painful |
| Web UI for recovery | Expand recover.html | v2 — after testing with real users |
| Automated yearly testing | Cron + email reminders | v1.1 |

---

## Implementation phases

### Phase 1 — Core (MVP)
1. `rememory init` — generate manifest template, guide user through filling it
2. `rememory seal` — encrypt with age (symmetric passphrase, auto-generated)
3. `rememory split` — Shamir split the passphrase
4. `rememory recover` — reconstruct + decrypt
5. `rememory verify` — round-trip test
7. Comprehensive tests: split → recover for every valid threshold combination

### Phase 2 — Distribution
7. `rememory bundle` — generate per-person ZIPs with binaries + docs
8. Cross-compile for 5 targets
9. WASM recovery fallback (recover.html)
10. PDF README generation (human-readable recovery guide)
11. `rememory status` — show config, rotation reminders
12. `rememory verify-bundle` — command used by share holders to check integrity of their bundle, and that code runs well. also possible from recover.html.

### Phase 3 — Operations
13. `rememory rotate` — re-key and re-bundle
14. Share holder management (add/remove people, update contacts)
15. Yearly check/reminder system (could be as simple as a calendar invite generator)

### Phase 4 — Extensions (future)
16. Dead man's switch integration
17. Timelock encryption layer
18. Encrypted cloud distribution option (share holders get a link instead of a USB)

## Testing strategy

The most important property: **recovery always works.** Every code path that touches crypto must be tested with round-trip verification.

- **Unit tests:** SSS split/combine for all valid threshold/share combinations (2-of-3 through 10-of-10)
- **Integration tests:** full `seal → split → bundle → recover` pipeline
- **Fuzz tests:** corrupted shares should fail gracefully with clear error messages, never produce wrong output silently
- **Cross-platform tests:** recovery works on all 5 target platforms
- **WASM tests:** recover.html produces identical results to CLI
- **Archival tests:** bundles from old versions can still be recovered (backward compatibility contract)
- **Human tests:** give a bundle to a real person, see if they can recover without your help
